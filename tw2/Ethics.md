Ethical Things in Software Engineering

1) Competence is important in software engineering. You would not want to be responsbile for an important project that is not possible for you 
    to complete. You would not want to cause others harm for being over confident.
    
2) It is important to protect the intellectual property of the company by not sharing sensitive information with other companies. It is morally 
    wrong to distribute that information for personal gain.
    
3) It is important to be honest. If you are not honest, then it creates a snowball effect. You will need to continue lying in order to keep up the 
    original lie. It is best to just be honest. Others will appreciate your honesty.
